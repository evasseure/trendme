# trendme
![Site screenshot](./screenshot.png)

A small website that aggregates github trending repos.  
It's my first project in clojure, so hopefuly the code is not too bad.  

By default you will have the languages: javascript, typescript, python, html, clojure.  
To display specific languages you have to use the url parameter `l` with a comma separated list of languages.  
ex: https://trendme.evass.co/?l=c,zig,rust
